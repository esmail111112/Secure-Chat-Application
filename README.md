🔒 Secure Chat Application (Python Project)

This project is a secure  chat application built using Python. It allows two users to communicate directly over a network with full message encryption.

🔐 How it works:
The chat uses hybrid encryption – the host generates a symmetric encryption key and shares it securely with the peer. After that, all communication is encrypted using the Fernet symmetric encryption method.

📌 Key Features:

Direct peer-to-peer communication (no message relayed through a server)

Full encryption of chat messages using the cryptography library

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) for clean and modular code

Simple and lightweight – ideal for learning or student projects

🧰 Technologies Used:

Python

Socket programming

Cryptography (Fernet)

Threading

OOP principles

📁 Project Files:

signaling_server.py – A helper server to match two clients

client_host.py – The host client that listens for connections

client_peer.py – The peer client that connects to the host

✅ Perfect for final-year projects, networking/security demos, or anyone learning about encrypted communication in Python.
